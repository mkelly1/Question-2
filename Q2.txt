Question #2 9/3/2019

Algorithm
Enter roof width and height in feet
Multiply width and height by 12 to convert to inches
Enter inches of water
Multiply width and height in inches to find area
Multiply area by inches of rain to get volume_of_water
Divide volume_of_water by 231 to convert volume_of_water to gallons
Output volume_of_water in gallons

Pseudocode
Prompt user for Length in feet
int Length = Length * 12
Prompt user for Width in feet
int Width = Width * 12
Prompt user for inches of water
int Inches_of_Water
volume_of_water = Multiply Inches_of_Waterof water with Length with Width
gallons_of_water = volume of water divided by 231
output gallons_of_water
